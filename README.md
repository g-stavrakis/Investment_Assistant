# Investment Assistant


# Problem Description

Investors and traders often face challenges when analyzing 10-K reports from large companies due to their length and complexity. These reports are packed with detailed financial statements, risk disclosures, management discussion and analysis (MD&A), making it difficult to quickly extract relevant insights. For casual investors, understanding financial jargon and metrics can be overwhelming, while experienced investors struggle with the time-consuming process of analyzing multiple reports. The critical information, such as key risks or growth opportunities, is often buried deep within the documents, and the need to act fast on new data makes the process even more daunting.
