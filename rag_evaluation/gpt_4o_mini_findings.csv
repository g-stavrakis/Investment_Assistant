3675584f,What are the main factors that could influence the growth of the ESKD patient population in the U.S.?,"Factors that may impact the growth rates of the ESKD patient population include mortality rates for dialysis patients or CKD patients, the aging of the U.S. population, transplant rates, incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure such as diabetes and hypertension, and growth rates of minority populations with higher than average incidence rates of ESKD.","The main factors that could influence the growth of the ESKD patient population in the U.S. include:

1. Mortality rates for dialysis patients or CKD patients.
2. The aging of the U.S. population.
3. Transplant rates.
4. Incidence rates for diseases that cause kidney failure, such as diabetes and hypertension.

58bc0581,Can you tell me the percentage increase of investment income for Humana Inc. from 2022 to 2023?,$0.7 billion,"To calculate the percentage increase of investment income for Humana Inc. from 2022 to 2023, we first need to identify the figures for investment income for both years. 

From the context provided:
- The increase in investment income from 2022 to 2023 is $0.7 billion.

We do not have the exact figures for the investment income in 2022, but we can calculate the percentage increase using the increase amount and the original amount (investment income in 2022).

Let \( I_{2022} \) be the investment income in 2022. So, the investment income in 2023 would be:

\[ I_{2023} = I_{2022} + 0.7 \text{ billion} \]

The percentage increase in investment income from 2022 to 2023 is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{I_{2023} - I_{2022}}{I_{2022}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting \( I_{2023} \) into the formula gives:
\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{(I_{2022} + 0.7) - I_{2022}}{I_{2022}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.7}{I_{2022}} \right) \times 100
\]

We do not have the value of \( I_{2022} \) from the provided context, so we cannot compute a specific percentage increase without this figure.

In summary, without the investment income for 2022, we cannot provide a specific percentage increase from 2022 to 2023.",Humana Inc.
58bc0581,What factors contributed to the increase in investment income for Humana Inc. during that period?,$0.7 billion,"The increase in investment income for Humana Inc. during that period was contributed to by the fair value of the total invested assets, which amounted to $21,590 million as of December 31, 2023.
